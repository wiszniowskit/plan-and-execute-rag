This article builds on the data transformation activities article, which presents a general overview of data transformation and the supported transformation activities. Azure Databricks is a managed platform for running Apache Spark.\\n\\nYou can create a Databricks notebook with an ARM template using JSON, or directly through the Azure Data Factory Studio user interface. For a step-by-step walkthrough of how to create a Databricks notebook activity using the user interface, reference the tutorial Run a Databricks notebook with the Databricks Notebook Activity in Azure Data Factory.\\n\\nAdd a Notebook activity for Azure Databricks to a pipeline with UI\\n\\nTo use a Notebook activity for Azure Databricks in a pipeline, complete the following steps:\\n\\nSearch for Notebook in the pipeline Activities pane, and drag a Notebook activity to the pipeline canvas.\\n\\nSelect the new Notebook activity on the canvas if it is not already selected.\\n\\nSelect the Azure Databricks tab to select or create a new Azure Databricks linked service that will execute the Notebook activity.\\n\\n:::image type=\"content\" source=\"media/transform-data-databricks-notebook/notebook-activity.png\" alt-text=\"Shows the UI for a Notebook activity.\":::\\n\\nSelect the Settings tab and specify the notebook path to be executed on Azure Databricks, optional base parameters to be passed to the notebook, and any additional libraries to be installed on the cluster to execute the job.\\n\\n:::image type=\"content\" source=\"media/transform-data-databricks-notebook/notebook-settings.png\" alt-text=\"Shows the UI for the Settings tab for a Notebook activity.\":::\\n\\nDatabricks Notebook activity definition\\n\\nHere is the sample JSON definition of a Databricks Notebook Activity:\\n\\njson { \"activity\": { \"name\": \"MyActivity\", \"description\": \"MyActivity description\", \"type\": \"DatabricksNotebook\", \"linkedServiceName\": { \"referenceName\": \"MyDatabricksLinkedservice\", \"type\": \"LinkedServiceReference\" }, \"typeProperties\": { \"notebookPath\": \"/Users/user@example.com/ScalaExampleNotebook\", \"baseParameters\": { \"inputpath\": \"input/folder1/\", \"outputpath\": \"output/\" }, \"libraries\": [ { \"jar\": \"dbfs:/docs/library.jar\" } ] } } }\\n\\nDatabricks Notebook activity properties\\n\\nThe following table describes the JSON properties used in the JSON definition:\\n\\nProperty Description Required name Name of the activity in the pipeline. Yes description Text describing what the activity does. No type For Databricks Notebook Activity, the activity type is DatabricksNotebook. Yes linkedServiceName Name of the Databricks Linked Service on which the Databricks notebook runs. To learn about this linked service, see Compute linked services article. Yes notebookPath The absolute path of the notebook to be run in the Databricks Workspace. This path must begin with a slash. Yes baseParameters An array of Key-Value pairs. Base parameters can be used for each activity run. If the notebook takes a parameter that is not specified, the default value from the notebook will be used. Find more on parameters in Databricks Notebooks . No libraries A list of libraries to be installed on the cluster that will execute the job. It can be an array of \\\\ . No\\n\\nSupported libraries for Databricks activities\\n\\nIn the above Databricks activity definition, you specify these library types: jar, egg, whl, maven, pypi, cran.\\n\\n```json { \"libraries\": [ { \"jar\": \"dbfs:/mnt/libraries/library.jar\" }, { \"egg\": \"dbfs:/mnt/libraries/library.egg\" }, { \"whl\": \"dbfs:/mnt/libraries/mlflow-0.0.1.dev0-py2-none-any.whl\" }, { \"whl\": \"dbfs:/mnt/libraries/wheel-libraries', doc_id='121e72e2-baa0-4c9b-aeec-e9bdc1b120b1', wins=13), Node(metadata={'source': '/Users/tomasz/plan-and-execute-rag/docs/transform-data-databricks-notebook.md'}, page_content='.wheelhouse.zip\" }, { \"maven\": { \"coordinates\": \"org.jsoup:jsoup:1.7.2\", \"exclusions\": [ \"slf4j:slf4j\" ] } }, { \"pypi\": { \"package\": \"simplejson\", \"repo\": \"http://my-pypi-mirror.com\" } }, { \"cran\": { \"package\": \"ada\", \"repo\": \"https://cran.us.r-project.org\" } } ] }\\n\\n```\\n\\nFor more information, see the Databricks documentation for library types.\\n\\nPassing parameters between notebooks and pipelines\\n\\nYou can pass parameters to notebooks using baseParameters property in databricks activity.\\n\\nIn certain cases, you might require to pass back certain values from notebook back to the service, which can be used for control flow (conditional checks) in the service or be consumed by downstream activities (size limit is 2 MB).\\n\\nIn your notebook, you may call dbutils.notebook.exit(\"returnValue\") and corresponding \"returnValue\" will be returned to the service.\\n\\nYou can consume the output in the service by using expression such as @{activity(\\'databricks notebook activity name\\').output.runOutput}.\\n\\n[!IMPORTANT] If you are passing JSON object you can retrieve values by appending property names. Example: @{activity(\\'databricks notebook activity name\\').output.runOutput.PropertyName}\\n\\nHow to upload a library in Databricks\\n\\nYou can use the Workspace UI:\\n\\nUse the Databricks workspace UI\\n\\nTo obtain the dbfs path of the library added using UI, you can use Databricks CLI.\\n\\nTypically the Jar libraries are stored under dbfs:/FileStore/jars while using the UI. You can list all through the CLI: databricks fs ls dbfs:/FileStore/job-jars\\n\\nOr you can use the Databricks CLI:\\n\\nFollow Copy the library using Databricks CLI\\n\\nUse Databricks CLI (installation steps)\\n\\nAs an example, to copy a JAR to dbfs: dbfs cp SparkPi-assembly-0.1.jar dbfs:/docs/sparkpi.jar', doc_id='5bf69f1f-9d9e-4ea3-bf01-d59c40f0a0f7', wins=13)],

ms.topic: conceptual ms.date: 05/15/2024\\n\\nTransform data by running a Databricks notebook\\n\\n[!INCLUDEappliesto-adf-asa-md]\\n\\nThe Azure Databricks Notebook Activity in a pipeline runs a Databricks notebook in your Azure Databricks workspace. This article builds on the data transformation activities article, which presents a general overview of data transformation and the supported transformation activities. Azure Databricks is a managed platform for running Apache Spark.\\n\\nYou can create a Databricks notebook with an ARM template using JSON, or directly through the Azure Data Factory Studio user interface. For a step-by-step walkthrough of how to create a Databricks notebook activity using the user interface, reference the tutorial Run a Databricks notebook with the Databricks Notebook Activity in Azure Data Factory.\\n\\nAdd a Notebook activity for Azure Databricks to a pipeline with UI\\n\\nTo use a Notebook activity for Azure Databricks in a pipeline, complete the following steps:\\n\\nSearch for Notebook in the pipeline Activities pane, and drag a Notebook activity to the pipeline canvas.\\n\\nSelect the new Notebook activity on the canvas if it is not already selected.\\n\\nSelect the Azure Databricks tab to select or create a new Azure Databricks linked service that will execute the Notebook activity.\\n\\n:::image type=\"content\" source=\"media/transform-data-databricks-notebook/notebook-activity.png\" alt-text=\"Shows the UI for a Notebook activity.\":::\\n\\nSelect the Settings tab and specify the notebook path to be executed on Azure Databricks, optional base parameters to be passed to the notebook, and any additional libraries to be installed on the cluster to execute the job.\\n\\n:::image type=\"content\" source=\"media/transform-data-databricks-notebook/notebook-settings.png\" alt-text=\"Shows the UI for the Settings tab for a Notebook activity.\":::\\n\\nDatabricks Notebook activity definition\\n\\nHere is the sample JSON definition of a Databricks Notebook Activity:\\n\\njson { \"activity\": { \"name\": \"MyActivity\", \"description\": \"MyActivity description\", \"type\": \"DatabricksNotebook\", \"linkedServiceName\": { \"referenceName\": \"MyDatabricksLinkedservice\", \"type\": \"LinkedServiceReference\" }, \"typeProperties\": { \"notebookPath\": \"/Users/user@example.com/ScalaExampleNotebook\", \"baseParameters\": { \"inputpath\": \"input/folder1/\", \"outputpath\": \"output/\" }, \"libraries\": [ { \"jar\": \"dbfs:/docs/library.jar\" } ] } } }\\n\\nDatabricks Notebook activity properties\\n\\nThe following table describes the JSON properties used in the JSON definition:\\n\\nProperty Description Required name Name of the activity in the pipeline. Yes description Text describing what the activity does. No type For Databricks Notebook Activity, the activity type is DatabricksNotebook. Yes linkedServiceName Name of the Databricks Linked Service on which the Databricks notebook runs. To learn about this linked service, see Compute linked services article. Yes notebookPath The absolute path of the notebook to be run in the Databricks Workspace. This path must begin with a slash. Yes baseParameters An array of Key-Value pairs. Base parameters can be used for each activity run. If the notebook takes a parameter that is not specified, the default value from the notebook will be used. Find more on parameters in Databricks Notebooks . No libraries A list of libraries to be installed on the cluster that will execute the job. It can be an array of \\\\ . No\\n\\nSupported libraries for Databricks activities\\n\\nIn the above Databricks activity definition, you specify these library types: jar, egg, whl, maven, pypi, cran.\\n\\n```json { \"libraries\": [ { \"jar\": \"dbfs:/mnt/libraries/library.jar\" }, { \"egg\": \"dbfs:/mnt/libraries/library.egg\" }, { \"whl\": \"dbfs:/mnt/libraries/mlflow-0.0.1.dev0-py2-none-any.whl\" }, { \"whl\": \"dbfs:/mnt/libraries/wheel-libraries', doc_id='121e72e2-baa0-4c9b-aeec-e9bdc1b120b1', wins=13), '5bf69f1f-9d9e-4ea3-bf01-d59c40f0a0f7': Node(metadata={'source': '/Users/tomasz/plan-and-execute-rag/docs/transform-data-databricks-notebook.md'}, page_content='.wheelhouse.zip\" }, { \"maven\": { \"coordinates\": \"org.jsoup:jsoup:1.7.2\", \"exclusions\": [ \"slf4j:slf4j\" ] } }, { \"pypi\": { \"package\": \"simplejson\", \"repo\": \"http://my-pypi-mirror.com\" } }, { \"cran\": { \"package\": \"ada\", \"repo\": \"https://cran.us.r-project.org\" } } ] }\\n\\n```\\n\\nFor more information, see the Databricks documentation for library types.\\n\\nPassing parameters between notebooks and pipelines\\n\\nYou can pass parameters to notebooks using baseParameters property in databricks activity.\\n\\nIn certain cases, you might require to pass back certain values from notebook back to the service, which can be used for control flow (conditional checks) in the service or be consumed by downstream activities (size limit is 2 MB).\\n\\nIn your notebook, you may call dbutils.notebook.exit(\"returnValue\") and corresponding \"returnValue\" will be returned to the service.\\n\\nYou can consume the output in the service by using expression such as @{activity(\\'databricks notebook activity name\\').output.runOutput}.\\n\\n[!IMPORTANT] If you are passing JSON object you can retrieve values by appending property names. Example: @{activity(\\'databricks notebook activity name\\').output.runOutput.PropertyName}\\n\\nHow to upload a library in Databricks\\n\\nYou can use the Workspace UI:\\n\\nUse the Databricks workspace UI\\n\\nTo obtain the dbfs path of the library added using UI, you can use Databricks CLI.\\n\\nTypically the Jar libraries are stored under dbfs:/FileStore/jars while using the UI. You can list all through the CLI: databricks fs ls dbfs:/FileStore/job-jars\\n\\nOr you can use the Databricks CLI:\\n\\nFollow Copy the library using Databricks CLI\\n\\nUse Databricks CLI (installation steps)\\n\\nAs an example, to copy a JAR to dbfs: dbfs cp SparkPi-assembly-0.1.jar dbfs:/docs/sparkpi.jar', doc_id='5bf69f1f-9d9e-4ea3-bf01-d59c40f0a0f7', wins=14)}, run_config=RunConfig(timeout=180, max_retries=15, max_wait=90, max_workers=16, exception_types=<class 'openai.RateLimitError'>, log_tenacity=False, seed=42)), node_filter=NodeFilter(llm=LangchainLLMWrapper(run_config=RunConfig(timeout=180, max_retries=15, max_wait=90, max_workers=16, exception_types=<class 'openai.RateLimitError'>, log_tenacity=False, seed=42)), threshold=1.5, context_scoring_prompt=Prompt(name='score_context', instruction='\\n    Given a context, perform the following task and output the answer in VALID JSON format: Assess the provided context and assign a numerical score of 1 (Low), 2 (Medium), or 3 (High) for each of the following criteria in your JSON response:\\n\\nclarity: Evaluate the precision and understandability of the information presented. High scores (3) are reserved for contexts that are both precise in their information and easy to understand. Low scores (1) are for contexts where the information is vague or hard to comprehend.\\ndepth: Determine the level of detailed examination and the inclusion of innovative insights within the context.

ms.topic: conceptual ms.date: 05/15/2024\\n\\nTransform data by running a Databricks notebook\\n\\n[!INCLUDEappliesto-adf-asa-md]\\n\\nThe Azure Databricks Notebook Activity in a pipeline runs a Databricks notebook in your Azure Databricks workspace. This article builds on the data transformation activities article, which presents a general overview of data transformation and the supported transformation activities. Azure Databricks is a managed platform for running Apache Spark.\\n\\nYou can create a Databricks notebook with an ARM template using JSON, or directly through the Azure Data Factory Studio user interface. For a step-by-step walkthrough of how to create a Databricks notebook activity using the user interface, reference the tutorial Run a Databricks notebook with the Databricks Notebook Activity in Azure Data Factory.\\n\\nAdd a Notebook activity for Azure Databricks to a pipeline with UI\\n\\nTo use a Notebook activity for Azure Databricks in a pipeline, complete the following steps:\\n\\nSearch for Notebook in the pipeline Activities pane, and drag a Notebook activity to the pipeline canvas.\\n\\nSelect the new Notebook activity on the canvas if it is not already selected.\\n\\nSelect the Azure Databricks tab to select or create a new Azure Databricks linked service that will execute the Notebook activity.\\n\\n:::image type=\"content\" source=\"media/transform-data-databricks-notebook/notebook-activity.png\" alt-text=\"Shows the UI for a Notebook activity.\":::\\n\\nSelect the Settings tab and specify the notebook path to be executed on Azure Databricks, optional base parameters to be passed to the notebook, and any additional libraries to be installed on the cluster to execute the job.\\n\\n:::image type=\"content\" source=\"media/transform-data-databricks-notebook/notebook-settings.png\" alt-text=\"Shows the UI for the Settings tab for a Notebook activity.\":::\\n\\nDatabricks Notebook activity definition\\n\\nHere is the sample JSON definition of a Databricks Notebook Activity:\\n\\njson { \"activity\": { \"name\": \"MyActivity\", \"description\": \"MyActivity description\", \"type\": \"DatabricksNotebook\", \"linkedServiceName\": { \"referenceName\": \"MyDatabricksLinkedservice\", \"type\": \"LinkedServiceReference\" }, \"typeProperties\": { \"notebookPath\": \"/Users/user@example.com/ScalaExampleNotebook\", \"baseParameters\": { \"inputpath\": \"input/folder1/\", \"outputpath\": \"output/\" }, \"libraries\": [ { \"jar\": \"dbfs:/docs/library.jar\" } ] } } }\\n\\nDatabricks Notebook activity properties\\n\\nThe following table describes the JSON properties used in the JSON definition:\\n\\nProperty Description Required name Name of the activity in the pipeline. Yes description Text describing what the activity does. No type For Databricks Notebook Activity, the activity type is DatabricksNotebook. Yes linkedServiceName Name of the Databricks Linked Service on which the Databricks notebook runs. To learn about this linked service, see Compute linked services article. Yes notebookPath The absolute path of the notebook to be run in the Databricks Workspace. This path must begin with a slash. Yes baseParameters An array of Key-Value pairs. Base parameters can be used for each activity run. If the notebook takes a parameter that is not specified, the default value from the notebook will be used. Find more on parameters in Databricks Notebooks . No libraries A list of libraries to be installed on the cluster that will execute the job. It can be an array of \\\\ . No\\n\\nSupported libraries for Databricks activities\\n\\nIn the above Databricks activity definition, you specify these library types: jar, egg, whl, maven, pypi, cran.\\n\\n```json { \"libraries\": [ { \"jar\": \"dbfs:/mnt/libraries/library.jar\" }, { \"egg\": \"dbfs:/mnt/libraries/library.egg\" }, { \"whl\": \"dbfs:/mnt/libraries/mlflow-0.0.1.dev0-py2-none-any.whl\" }, { \"whl\": \"dbfs:/mnt/libraries/wheel-libraries', doc_id='121e72e2-baa0-4c9b-aeec-e9bdc1b120b1', wins=14), '5bf69f1f-9d9e-4ea3-bf01-d59c40f0a0f7': Node(metadata={'source': '/Users/tomasz/plan-and-execute-rag/docs/transform-data-databricks-notebook.md'}, page_content='.wheelhouse.zip\" }, { \"maven\": { \"coordinates\": \"org.jsoup:jsoup:1.7.2\", \"exclusions\": [ \"slf4j:slf4j\" ] } }, { \"pypi\": { \"package\": \"simplejson\", \"repo\": \"http://my-pypi-mirror.com\" } }, { \"cran\": { \"package\": \"ada\", \"repo\": \"https://cran.us.r-project.org\" } } ] }\\n\\n```\\n\\nFor more information, see the Databricks documentation for library types.\\n\\nPassing parameters between notebooks and pipelines\\n\\nYou can pass parameters to notebooks using baseParameters property in databricks activity.\\n\\nIn certain cases, you might require to pass back certain values from notebook back to the service, which can be used for control flow (conditional checks) in the service or be consumed by downstream activities (size limit is 2 MB).\\n\\nIn your notebook, you may call dbutils.notebook.exit(\"returnValue\") and corresponding \"returnValue\" will be returned to the service.\\n\\nYou can consume the output in the service by using expression such as @{activity(\\'databricks notebook activity name\\').output.runOutput}.\\n\\n[!IMPORTANT] If you are passing JSON object you can retrieve values by appending property names. Example: @{activity(\\'databricks notebook activity name\\').output.runOutput.PropertyName}\\n\\nHow to upload a library in Databricks\\n\\nYou can use the Workspace UI:\\n\\nUse the Databricks workspace UI\\n\\nTo obtain the dbfs path of the library added using UI, you can use Databricks CLI.\\n\\nTypically the Jar libraries are stored under dbfs:/FileStore/jars while using the UI. You can list all through the CLI: databricks fs ls dbfs:/FileStore/job-jars\\n\\nOr you can use the Databricks CLI:\\n\\nFollow Copy the library using Databricks CLI\\n\\nUse Databricks CLI (installation steps)\\n\\nAs an example, to copy a JAR to dbfs: dbfs cp SparkPi-assembly-0.1.jar dbfs:/docs/sparkpi.jar', doc_id='5bf69f1f-9d9e-4ea3-bf01-d59c40f0a0f7', wins=15)}, run_config=RunConfig(timeout=180, max_retries=15, max_wait=90, max_workers=16, exception_types=<class 'openai.RateLimitError'>, log_tenacity=False, seed=42)), node_filter=NodeFilter(llm=LangchainLLMWrapper(run_config=RunConfig(timeout=180, max_retries=15, max_wait=90, max_workers=16, exception_types=<class 'openai.RateLimitError'>, log_tenacity=False, seed=42)), threshold=1.5, context_scoring_prompt=Prompt(name='score_context', instruction='\\n    Given a context, perform the following task and output the answer in VALID JSON format: Assess the provided context and assign a numerical score of 1 (Low), 2 (Medium), or 3 (High) for each of the following criteria in your JSON response:\\n\\nclarity: Evaluate the precision and understandability of the information presented.

Global reproductive rights organizations have adjusted their strategies, intensifying advocacy efforts and building coalitions in response to the ruling. There is a potential for the decision to inspire anti-abortion legislation in countries that look to the US as a model, which could lead to a ripple effect of restrictive policies. Conversely, it may also galvanize advocates for reproductive rights worldwide to protect and expand access to safe abortion services, highlighting the ruling's far-reaching consequences on women's health and autonomy globally.\n",

      "Response: The overall political context in Nicaragua has been shaped by a history of authoritarian governance, particularly under the leadership of Daniel Ortega and the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN). Since returning to power in 2007, Ortega has increasingly consolidated control over state institutions and the judiciary, undermining democratic norms and the rule of law. Historical grievances stemming from the Sandinista revolution and counter-revolution have also contributed to a polarized political climate, where dissent is viewed as a threat to the regime. Socially, the government has utilized propaganda to promote a narrative that portrays civil society organizations as foreign agents or adversaries, further legitimizing repression. The culmination of these factors has resulted in a systematic crackdown on dissent, including the use of violence, intimidation, and restrictive laws that stifle civil society's ability to operate and advocate for human rights.\n",

These challenges include: 1. **Defining Harmful Content**: There is often ambiguity regarding what constitutes harmful content, making it difficult to create clear guidelines that protect users without infringing on free speech. 2. **Censorship Concerns**: Efforts to moderate harmful content can lead to accusations of censorship, particularly when content removal disproportionately affects certain groups or political views. 3. **Algorithmic Bias**: Automated moderation systems may misinterpret context, leading to the suppression of legitimate expression while failing to catch harmful content. 4. **User Expectations**: Users have varying expectations regarding content moderation, with some wanting stricter protections while others prioritize freedom of expression, creating a conflict in policy implementation. 5. **Legal and Regulatory Pressures**: Social media companies must navigate complex legal frameworks that differ by country, complicating their ability to implement consistent policies globally. 6. **Resource Allocation**: Effective moderation requires substantial resources, including human oversight, which can be costly and logistically challenging for companies. 7. **Public Backlash**: Companies face the risk of public backlash regardless of their approach, whether they take down harmful content or allow it to remain, leading to reputational risks and user trust issues. In conclusion, the balancing act between protecting users and upholding free expression is fraught with challenges that require careful consideration and a nuanced approach.\n",
